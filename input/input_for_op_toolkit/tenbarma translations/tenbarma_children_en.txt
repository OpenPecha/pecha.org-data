To the seven special buddhas,
We say hello and thank you!
You are like heroes who help everyone,
And we bow to show we care.

I did hard things to help others,
And didn't think about myself.
I hope this makes the teachings
Shine bright for a long time!

I gave my life to help sick people,
So they could feel better.
I hope this helps the poor too,
And makes the teachings last!

I gave away my family and toys,
My animals and things I ride,
To find something very special.
May the teachings stay strong!

I gave gifts to many wise people,
Who teach us how to be good.
They are called buddhas and other names,
May their words help everyone!

I had a hard time for a long while,
But I kept learning to be better.
I hope this helps the teachings
Stay bright for many years!

I followed rules and did tough things,
For a very long time.
I gave gifts to buddhas everywhere,
May their words spread far!

I worked hard and never gave up,
Even when things were tough.
I want to help all living things,
May the teachings grow strong!

I was patient when others were mean,
Because they felt sad or angry.
I didn't get mad at them,
May kindness spread everywhere!

I sat still and thought deeply,
About many important things.
I hope this makes the teachings
Last for a very long time!

I lived in the forest to learn,
And shared what I knew with others.
I taught them many good things,
May wisdom grow and grow!

I gave my body to help others,
Because I cared about them so much.
I even gave my arms and legs,
May goodness spread all around!

I helped mean people become nice,
With lots of love and kindness.
I showed them three ways to be good,
May more people learn these ways!

I helped people think better thoughts,
When they had silly ideas.
I showed them the right way to think,
May good thoughts spread far!

I made friends in four special ways,
To help them not feel so sad.
I stopped bad things from growing,
May my friends stay for a long time!

I helped people with wrong ideas,
To see things in a better way.
I showed them the right path to follow,
May my friends always be happy!
May the teachings shine bright forever!
